# cycle-react-pragma
A jsx pragma for @cycle/react

## Motivation

Although JSX only has secondary support in [Cycle.js](https://github.com/cyclejs), it is highly familiar to users of [React](https://github.com/facebook/react).

Recently, it was made possible to [render React components in Cycle and vice versa](https://staltz.com/use-react-in-cyclejs-and-vice-versa.html).

This pragma allows you to use React-style JSX when rendering React components in Cycle.js
